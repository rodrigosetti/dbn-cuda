GPU accelerated Deep Belief Network in Python

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_belief_network):

> In machine learning, a deep belief network (DBN) is a generative graphical model, or alternatively a
> type of deep neural network, composed of multiple layers of latent variables ("hidden units"), with
> connections between the layers but not between units within each layer.

> When trained on a set of examples in an unsupervised way, a DBN can
> learn to probabilistically reconstruct its inputs. The layers then act as feature detectors on inputs.
> After this learning step, a DBN can be further trained in a supervised way to perform classification.
